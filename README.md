# Neural-Style-Transfer

## About 
Neural Style Transfer (NST) refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks for the sake of image transformation. Common uses for NST are the creation of artificial artwork from photographs, for example by transferring the appearance of famous paintings to user-supplied photographs. Several notable mobile apps use NST techniques for this purpose, including DeepArt and Prisma. This method has been used by artists and designers around the globe to develop new artwork based on existent style(s).

## Idead Behind 

I decided to chose this beautiful picture from HK harbor and decided to combine it with Van Gogh 'starry night' image format. 

I was surprised to notice how good the style transfer was!

ps. the real reason i wanted to do this was to find a good painting for my room XD



Normal Image              |  Style to be applied

The Final image produced is similar to one shown below.(Note: you might get different output based on the hyparameter selection!
